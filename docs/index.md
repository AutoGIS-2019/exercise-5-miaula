Travel times to shopping centers:

I drifted into trying to use two legends on a plot. One for the travel time classification
and the other for the shopping centers. This turned out to be more complex than expected and 
was not successful. Taking too much time, I left it be for now. So, on the map there are 
travel times as a classification explained in the legend and the shopping center locations
presented as yellow X's marking the spots. The distinction of the shopping center category is
missing. That would have been in the other legend. Still, the map has some value presenting
overal distribution of some shopping centers and travel times to them in the Helsinki 
metropolitan area.


The Minoan Civilization map

The criteria was to include at least two layers on the map. There is just one layer proper
visible on the layer control panel, but the feature groups of markers presented as different 
categories of Minoan archaeological sites corresponds with the functionality sought after. 
In addition to Stamen Water Color layer, a layer of Stamen Toner Labels is present to bring 
place references, but not visible in the layer control panel. Trying to control the feature 
groups the way implemented here actually felt more trickier than just to add a layer more.
